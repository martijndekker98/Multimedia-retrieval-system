# Multimedia retrieval system
 
The practical part of the multimedia retrieval course consisted of creating a multimedia retrieval system. This program analyzes a 3D mesh and finds 3D meshes in its database that resemble the input mesh as much as possible. (It is similar to a reverse image search on Google where an image is uploaded and Google finds images that are most similar. The difference is that this program uses 3D meshes instead of images) <br>
